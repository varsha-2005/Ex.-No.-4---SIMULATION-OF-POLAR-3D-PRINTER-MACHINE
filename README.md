# Ex. No.4 SIMULATION OF POLAR 3D PRINTER MACHINE

### DATE: 

## AIM:
### To simulate the construction of polar 3D printer and to get in-depth knowledge of mechatronics of polar 3D printers.

## REQUIREMENTS:
### ‚óè	System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:

## Assembly of Polar 3D Printer
### 1.	Select 'Assembly of Polar 3D Printer' from the visible list.
### 2.	All the parts related to Polar 3D Printer will be shown on the screen.
### 3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
### 4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
### 5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
### 6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## Playing with Axes
### 1.	Move the r-axis slider and observe the movement of the r-axis assembly.
### 2.	Move the y-axis slider and observe the movement of the y-axis assembly.
### 3.	Move the z-axis slider and observe the movement of the z-axis assembly.

## OUTPUT:

Y-AXIS BASE :

The base of the printer that supports the rest of the components.

Z-AXIS FRAME :

This is the frame that holds the print head and moves it up and down along the vertical axis.

SMOOTH RODS :

The smooth rods that provide smooth and accurate movement of the Z-axis frame.

MOTORS :

provide the power to move the Z-axis frame and the print head.

EXTRUDER SUPPORTER :

The support structure that holds the extruder assembly.

THREADED ROD :

Threaded rod that provides the power to move the Z-axis frame up and down.

Y-AXIS FRAME :

The frame that moves the print head in the horizontal plane.

MOTOR WITH GEAR :

provides the power to move the Y-axis frame.

MOTOR-WITH-PULLEY :

provides the power to move the Z-axis frame.

GEARS :

Transfer power from the stepper motors to the threaded rod and the smooth rods.

PLATE :

plate where the printed object is created.

EXTRUDER :

melts and extrudes the filament to create the printed object.

FILAMENT :

material that is used to create the printed object.
